## How to host it for me?
 Well, you need to create an aplication, use `git clone https://github.com/Pandinhaa11/aoijs.git` on your random folder, or you just can download a .zip file of the repo.
 Then, you need:
 - Node.js
   or
 - PNPM
## Hosting

Now, just insert in the terminal: ```npm i``` to install all dependencies.
If you want to use PNPM, use ```pnpm add aoi.js```
After, you need to install @akarui/aoi.db and @akarui/aoi.js
```npm install @akarui/aoi.db``` and ```npm install @akarui/aoi.js```.

Now, just put your bot token in index.js and my template is running!!
Don't forget to change the `client.status`.
